This language has a well-defined semantics, which the printing engine implements. The language and its semantics rest upon a small number of fundamental concepts.</p><p>There are combinators for creating <b>atomic documents</b>. For instance, the <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-string" title="PPrint.string">string</a> combinator turns an OCaml string (which must not contain any newline character) into a document. Thus,</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>string &quot;hello&quot;</code></pre><p>is a simple, unbreakable document. The <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-utf8string" title="PPrint.utf8string">utf8string</a> combinator is analogous, and should be preferred when working with non-ASCII strings. The <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-utf8format" title="PPrint.utf8format">utf8format</a> combinator provides a convenient <code>sprintf</code>-style API for constructing a complex string and turning it into an atomic document.</p><p>There is a <b>concatenation</b> operator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-(^^)" title="PPrint.(^^)">(^^)</a>, which joins two documents. For instance,</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>string &quot;hello&quot; ^^ string &quot;world&quot;</code></pre><p>is a composite document. It is in fact equivalent to <code>string &quot;helloworld&quot;</code>.</p><p>A somewhat more interesting combinator is the <b>breakable blank</b> combinator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-break" title="PPrint.break">break</a>. This combinator expects a nonnegative integer argument, the width of the desired breakable blank. If <code>break n</code> is printed in flat mode, it produces <code>n</code> blank characters; if it is printed in normal mode, it produces one newline character.</p><p>As suggested by the previous sentence, there are <b>two printing modes</b>, namely <b>flat mode</b> and <b>normal mode</b>. The printing engine goes back and forth between these two modes. Exactly where and how the printing engine switches from one mode to the other is controlled by the next combinator.</p><p>The <b>grouping combinator</b>, <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a>, introduces <b>a choice between flat mode and normal mode</b>. It is a document transformer: if <code>d</code> is a document, then <code>group d</code> is a document. When the printing engine encounters <code>group d</code>, two possibilities arise. The first possibility is to print all of <code>d</code> on a single line. This is known as flat mode. The engine tries this first (ignoring all <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a> combinators inside <code>d</code>). If it succeeds, great. If it fails, by lack of space on the current line, then the engine reverts to the second possibility, which is to dissolve the group and print the bare document <code>d</code> in normal mode. This has subtle consequences: there might be further groups inside <code>d</code>, and each of these groups gives rise to further choices.</p><p>At each group, the choice is resolved in an efficient way. No backtracking is required. The ideal width of every document is computed (in a bottom-up manner) when documents are constructed. This allows every choice to be resolved in constant time. The time complexity of building and rendering documents is linear in the size of the document.</p><h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples" class="anchor"></a>Examples</h2><p>The interplay of <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-break" title="PPrint.break">break</a> and <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a> gives rise to an interesting language, where <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a> is used to indicate a choice point, and the appearance of <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-break" title="PPrint.break">break</a> is dependent upon the choice points that appear higher up in the hierarchical structure of the document. For instance, the document:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>group (string &quot;This&quot; ^^ break 1 ^^ string &quot;is&quot; ^^ break 1 ^^ string &quot;pretty.&quot;)</code></pre><p>is printed either on a single line, if it fits, or on three lines. It cannot be printed on two lines: there is just one choice point, so either the two breakable blanks are broken, or none of them is. By the way, this document can be abbreviated as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>group (string &quot;This&quot; ^/^ string &quot;is&quot; ^/^ string &quot;pretty.&quot;)</code></pre><p>On the other hand, the document:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>string &quot;This&quot; ^^
group (break 1 ^^ string &quot;is&quot;) ^^
group (break 1 ^^ string &quot;pretty.&quot;)</code></pre><p>can be printed on one, two, or three lines. There are two choice points, each of which influences one of the two breakable blanks. The two choices are independent of one another. Each of the words in the sentence <code>This is
pretty.</code> is printed on the current line if it fits, and on a new line otherwise. By the way, this document can be abbreviated as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>flow (break 1) [
  string &quot;This&quot;;
  string &quot;is&quot;;
  string &quot;pretty.&quot;
]</code></pre><p>or as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>flow_map (break 1) string [ &quot;This&quot;; &quot;is&quot;; &quot;pretty.&quot; ]</code></pre><h2 id="more-core-combinators"><a href="#more-core-combinators" class="anchor"></a>More Core Combinators</h2><p>As noted earlier, the string that is supplied to <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-string" title="PPrint.string">string</a>, <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-utf8string" title="PPrint.utf8string">utf8string</a>, or <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-utf8format" title="PPrint.utf8format">utf8format</a> must not contain any newline characters. If one wishes to impose a line break, one must use the <b>forced newline</b> combinator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-hardline" title="PPrint.hardline">hardline</a>.</p><p>Whereas <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a> introduces a choice between flat mode and normal mode, the <b>conditional construct</b> <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-ifflat" title="PPrint.ifflat">ifflat</a> allows testing whether the printing engine is currently in flat mode or in normal mode. The document <code>ifflat doc1 doc2</code> is rendered as <code>doc1</code> if the engine is currently in flat mode, and as <code>doc2</code> if the engine is currently in normal mode. This is a powerful combinator; however, one must be aware that <i>both branches are evaluated and constructed in memory</i> during the document construction phase. So, if used naively, <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-ifflat" title="PPrint.ifflat">ifflat</a> can cause exponential time and space usage. To avoid this danger, <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-ifflat" title="PPrint.ifflat">ifflat</a> should typically be applied to documents of constant size.</p><p>The <b>blank combinator</b> <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-blank" title="PPrint.blank">blank</a> is analogous to <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-break" title="PPrint.break">break</a>, but produces non-breakable blank characters. A blank character is like an ordinary ASCII space character <code>string &quot; &quot;</code>, except that blank characters at the end of a line are automatically suppressed. Thus, the printing engine guarantees that no trailing blank characters are ever produced.</p><p>To illustrate the power of these combinators, let us reveal that <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-break" title="PPrint.break">break</a> is in reality not a primitive combinator: it is defined in terms of <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-hardline" title="PPrint.hardline">hardline</a>, <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-blank" title="PPrint.blank">blank</a>, and <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-ifflat" title="PPrint.ifflat">ifflat</a>. A possible definition of <code>break 1</code> is <code>ifflat
(blank 1) hardline</code>.</p><p>The <b>nesting</b> combinator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-nest" title="PPrint.nest">nest</a> deals with indentation. At every time, the printing engine maintains a <b>current indentation level</b>, which is a nonnegative integer. The current indentation level is initially zero. To render the document <code>nest 2 d</code>, the printing engine temporarily increases the current indentation level by 2, renders the document <code>d</code>, then restores the previous indentation level. The effect of the current indentation level is as follows: <b>every time a newline character is emitted, it is immediately followed by <code>n</code> blank characters</b>, where <code>n</code> is the current indentation level.</p><p>To illustrate the use of indentation, let us look at this document:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>group (
  string &quot;begin&quot; ^^
  nest 2 (break 1 ^^ string &quot;work&quot;) ^^
  break 1 ^^ string &quot;end&quot;
)</code></pre><p>Although this document looks somewhat complicated, understanding its behavior is relatively easy, because there is only one <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a> combinator in it. This document can be printed in one of two ways. If it fits on the current line, then the content of the group is rendered in flat mode: <code>break 1</code> becomes equivalent to <code>blank 1</code>, and (because no newline characters are emitted) <code>nest 2</code> has no effect. The document is then rendered as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>begin work end</code></pre><p>If the document does <i>not</i> fit on the current line, then the group is dissolved, and <code>break 1</code> becomes equivalent to <code>hardline</code>. Thus, the document becomes equivalent to:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>string &quot;begin&quot; ^^
nest 2 (hardline ^^ string &quot;work&quot;) ^^
hardline ^^ string &quot;end&quot;</code></pre><p>Thanks to the <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-nest" title="PPrint.nest">nest</a> combinator, the first <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-hardline" title="PPrint.hardline">hardline</a> is immediately followed with two blank characters, whereas the second <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-hardline" title="PPrint.hardline">hardline</a> is not. The document is then rendered as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>begin
  work
end</code></pre><p>The <b>alignment</b> combinator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-align" title="PPrint.align">align</a> can be used to change the current indentation level in a more subtle way. The effect of this combinator is to set the current indentation level to the current column. To understand what this means, let us look at this document:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>string &quot;please&quot; ^/^ align (group (string &quot;align&quot; ^/^ string &quot;here&quot;))</code></pre><p>If this document fits on the current line, then neither <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-align" title="PPrint.align">align</a> nor <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-group" title="PPrint.group">group</a> have any effect, so the document is rendered as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>please align here</code></pre><p>If the document does <i>not</i> fit on the current line, then the group is dissolved. The second concatenation operator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-(^/^)" title="PPrint.(^/^)">(^/^)</a> inserts a breakable blank <code>break 1</code>, which is in this case is equivalent to <code>hardline</code>. Because the current indentation level is set by <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-align" title="PPrint.align">align</a> to the column that follows &quot;<code>please </code>&quot;, the document is rendered as follows:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>please align
       here</code></pre><p>This concludes our review of <code>PPrint</code>'s core combinators. Not every combinator has been mentioned here; for further details, please consult <a href="PPrint/index.html#building" title="building">the complete list</a> of the core combinators for building documents.</p><p>On top of the core combinators, it is up to the user of the library to define higher-level combinators that are more convenient or better suited to a particular use case. <code>PPrint</code> itself comes with <a href="PPrint/index.html#combinators" title="combinators">a collection of high-level combinators</a>, and the submodule <a href="PPrint/OCaml/index.html"><code>PPrint.OCaml</code></a> offers a collection of combinators for <a href="PPrint/OCaml/index.html" title="PPrint.OCaml">printing OCaml values</a>. These collections are not as complete and thoughtfully designed as they could be. They are subject to change in the future.</p><h2 id="rendering-documents"><a href="#rendering-documents" class="anchor"></a>Rendering Documents</h2><p>The submodules <a href="PPrint/ToChannel/index.html"><code>PPrint.ToChannel</code></a>, <a href="PPrint/ToBuffer/index.html"><code>PPrint.ToBuffer</code></a>, and <a href="PPrint/ToFormatter/index.html"><code>PPrint.ToFormatter</code></a> give access to the printing engine, and send their output respectively to an output channel of type <code>out_channel</code>, to a buffer of type <code>Buffer.t</code>, and to a formatter channel of type <code>Format.formatter</code>.</p><p>Each of these submodules offers a choice between two printing engines. The <a href="PPrint/ToChannel/index.html#val-pretty" title="PPrint.ToChannel.pretty">pretty</a> printing engine should be preferred in most situations; it attempts to respects the maximum line width and ribbon width specified by the user. The <a href="PPrint/ToChannel/index.html#val-compact" title="PPrint.ToChannel.compact">compact</a> printing engine can be used when the readability of the output does not matter: it assumes a maximum line width of zero (so it never flattens a group) and does not emit any indentation characters.</p><h2 id="defining-custom-documents"><a href="#defining-custom-documents" class="anchor"></a>Defining Custom Documents</h2><p>It is possible to extend <code>PPrint</code> with custom document constructors, provided they meet the expectations of the printing engine. In short, the <b>custom document</b> combinator <a href="PPrint/index.html#val-custom" title="PPrint.custom">custom</a> expects an object of class <a href="PPrint/class-type-custom/index.html" title="PPrint.custom">custom</a>. This object must provide three methods. The method <code>requirement</code> must compute the ideal width of the custom document. The methods <code>pretty</code> and <code>compact</code> must render the custom document. For this purpose, they have access to the <a href="PPrint/class-type-output/index.html" title="PPrint.output">output channel</a> and to the <a href="PPrint/index.html#type-state" title="PPrint.state">state</a> of the printing engine. For more details, see <a href="PPrint/index.html#defining" title="defining">Defining Custom Documents</a>.</p><h2 id="history-and-acknowledgements"><a href="#history-and-acknowledgements" class="anchor"></a>History and Acknowledgements</h2><p>The document language and the printing engine are inspired by Daan Leijen's <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wl-pprint">wl-pprint</a> library, which itself is based on the ideas developed by Philip Wadler in the paper <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf">A Prettier Printer</a>. This Haskell library exploits laziness to achieve a very low memory requirement: the entire document never needs to reside in memory. <code>PPrint</code> achieves greater simplicity and possibly higher throughput by requiring the entire document to be built in memory before it is printed.</p><p><code>PPrint</code> was written by <a href="http://cambium.inria.fr/~fpottier/">FranÃ§ois Pottier</a> and Nicolas Pouillard, with contributions by Yann RÃ©gis-Gianas, Gabriel Scherer, Jonathan Protzenko, and Thomas Refis.</p></div></body></html>
